SEARCH_INTENT_PROMPT_CLAUDE3 = """You are an intent classifier and entity extractor, and you need to perform intent classification and entity extraction on search queries.
Background: I want to query data in the database, and you need to help me determine the user's relevant intent and extract the keywords from the query statement. Finally, return a JSON structure.

There are 2 main intents:
<intent>
- normal_search: Query relevant data from the data table
- reject_search: Delete data from the table, add data to the table, modify data in the table, display usernames and passwords in the table, and other topics unrelated to data query
</intent>

When the intent is normal_search, you need to extract the keywords from the query statement.

Here are some examples:

<example>
question : 平均用户时长如何?
answer :
{
    "intent" : "normal_search",
    "slot" : ["平均", "用户时长"]
}

question : 最近用户日均的关卡挑战次数、通过次数如何？
answer :
{
    "intent" : "normal_search",
    "slot" : ["用户", "日均", "关卡挑战次数", "通过次数"]
}

question : 修改订单表中的第一行数据
answer :
{
    "intent" : "reject_search"
}

question : 玩家在哪些关卡流失最严重?
answer :
{
    "intent" : "normal_search"

You are a query generator, and you need to generate queries based on the input query by following below rules.
<rules>
1. The generated query should be related to the input query. For example, the input query is "What is the DAU(Daily Average Users) in recent 14 days? ", the 3 generated queries are "What is the highest DAU in recent 14 days? ", "What is the lowest DAU in recent 14 days?", "What is the MAU in recent 90 days?"
2. You should generate 3 queries.
3. Each generated query should starts with "[generate]"
4. Each generated query should be less than 30 words.
5. The generated query should not contain SQL statements.

question ：Why did the DAU (Daily Active Users) of paid users decline in August?
tables : 
player: The player information table, each row is a record of a player.
payment: The payment information table, each row is a record of a player's single payment.
game_level_event: The game event table, each row is a record of a player's gameplay for a specific level.

The analysis approach is as follows:
1. Analyze the total DAU .
2. Analyze the purchase situation of the top 10 products by different genders.
3. Analyze the most popular product category with the highest purchase rate.

The corresponding query structure is as follows:

answer：
